# My-PICO-8-game
This is a game I designed using the code from the PICO-8 game "PacMan In Hell" by amazing cat from https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?pid=126299#p

I changed the design to look like a mountain with trees and sky and clouds. I messed with some new sound effects to make it sound more ghostly like as well.
